# Learn GoLang 🧠

This is a personal repository I’m using to learn and practice the Go programming language.

It includes:

- ✅ A basic CRUD application
- 🛠️ Practice with structs, slices, maps, and other core Go features
- 📦 Simple experiments and hands-on exercises
- ✍️ Notes and code snippets for quick reference
